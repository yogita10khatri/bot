# 🤖 Polymarket Trading Bot v3.1 - Enhanced Risk Management

**The Ultimate Open-Source Automated Trading Bot for Polymarket**

[![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-English-blue)](README.md)
[![Arabic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Arabic-green)](README_AR.md)

**Created by**: [@Mr_CryptoYT](https://x.com/Mr_CryptoYT)

> This is a fork of [MrFadiAi/Polymarket-bot](https://github.com/MrFadiAi/Polymarket-bot),
> migrated to Polymarket's CLOB client v2 and extended with VPN/proxy support for
> restricted regions. All of the original strategy and risk work is upstream's.

## 🆕 What's New in this fork

### 🔌 **Migrated to CLOB Client v2**
- ✅ Now uses [`@polymarket/clob-client-v2`](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client-v2) instead of the v1 client
- ✅ Order signing verified against v2's EIP-712 domain — the existing ethers v5 wallet is used as the signer, so nothing else in the bot had to change
- ✅ v2 returns API errors as objects rather than throwing; every call site now handles that instead of mistaking an error body for a success

### 🌍 **VPN / proxy support for restricted regions**
- ✅ One `PROXY_URL` routes **all four** of the bot's network transports (`https`, `axios`, `fetch`, WebSockets)
- ✅ `npm run check:vpn` preflight: exit IP, exit country, leak cross-check, endpoint reachability
- ✅ Startup geo check plus a watchdog that catches a VPN dropping mid-session
- ✅ Docker + [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) setup with no route to the internet outside the tunnel
- 📖 **Read [`docs/VPN_SETUP.md`](docs/VPN_SETUP.md) before you trade** — it covers the account risk, not just the wiring

---

## 🆕 What's New in v3.1 (January 2026)

### 🔴 **Professional-Grade Risk Management**
- ✅ **4-Layer Protection System**: Daily (5%), Monthly (15%), Drawdown (25%), Total Loss Halt (40%)
- ✅ **Smart Money Filtering**: Only follow traders with 60%+ win rate, 1.5x profit factor, and consistency checks

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, you need three things:

### 💻 Computer Requirements
- **OS**: Windows, Mac, or Linux.
- **Node.js**: You must have Node.js installed (**Version 20.10 or higher** — required by Polymarket's CLOB client v2).
  - [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/) (Choose "LTS" version).
  - Check yours with `node --version`.
- **Git**: Required to download the code.
  - [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/).

### 💰 Wallet Requirements
- **A Polymarket Account**: Log in to [Polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com).
- **USDC (Polygon)**: You need funds to trade.
  - **USDC.e** is the specific token used on Polygon for Polymarket.
- **MATIC (Polygon)**: You need a small amount ($1-$5) for gas fees.

### 🔑 Private Key
- You need the **Private Key** of your wallet (e.g., from MetaMask or your Polymarket proxy wallet).
- *Security Note: Never share this key with anyone.*

---

## 2. Installation

Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and run these commands one by one.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Download the bot code to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProofOfNaina/bot.git
cd bot
```

*(Note: If you downloaded the ZIP file instead, just unzip it and open the folder in your terminal)*

### Step 2: Install Dependencies & Build Dashboard
This installs all the "parts" the bot needs to run and builds the dashboard interface.

```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Build the dashboard (Critical Step!)
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

*This process might take 1-3 minutes.*

---

## 3. Configuration

This is the most important step. We need to tell the bot your wallet details.

### Step 1: Create the .env File
1. Find the file named `.env.example` in the folder.
2. Copy it and rename the copy to `.env`.

### Step 2: Add Your Credentials
Open the `.env` file with any text editor (Notepad, VS Code) and fill in your details:

```env
# ==============================================
# 🔑 WALLET CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)
# ==============================================

# Your Wallet Private Key (Export from MetaMask)
# Format: 0x...
POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere

# ==============================================
# ⚙️ BOT SETTINGS
# ==============================================

# CAPITAL (Your risk budget - NOT your wallet balance)
# This determines position sizes and risk limits
# Start with a small amount for testing
CAPITAL_USD=250

# DRY RUN MODE
# "true" = Simulation Mode (No real money used, SAFE to test)
# "false" = Live Trading (Real money used, BE CAREFUL)
DRY_RUN=true

# 🆕 RISK MANAGEMENT (Optional - defaults are conservative)
DAILY_MAX_LOSS_PCT=0.05      # 5% daily loss limit
MONTHLY_MAX_LOSS_PCT=0.15    # 15% monthly loss limit
MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT=0.25        # 25% drawdown from peak
TOTAL_MAX_LOSS_PCT=0.40      # 40% total loss = permanent halt

# API Keys (Optional but recommended for speed)
# Get a free key from specific providers if you want better performance
# ALCHEMY_KEY=...

# ==============================================
# 🌍 VPN / PROXY (see section 4 and docs/VPN_SETUP.md)
# ==============================================
# Required if you are in a country Polymarket restricts, such as India.
# Leave empty if the machine is already on a full-tunnel VPN.
# PROXY_URL=socks5://username:password@proxy-host:1080
# REQUIRE_PROXY=true
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** 
- Start with `DRY_RUN=true` and `CAPITAL_USD=50` for testing
- Only change to `DRY_RUN=false` when you are 100% sure everything works

---

## 4. VPN / Restricted Regions

**Skip this section only if you are in a country Polymarket serves.** If you are
in India — or anywhere else on Polymarket's restricted list — read
**[`docs/VPN_SETUP.md`](docs/VPN_SETUP.md)** in full before going any further.

### The part that is not a technical problem

Polymarket's Terms of Service restrict access from certain jurisdictions.
Tunnelling around that is a breach of those terms. Accounts get closed for it,
and a closed account can leave funds stuck in positions you can no longer
manage. Your own local rules may also apply. This fork gives you the plumbing;
the decision and the consequences are yours.

If you go ahead: **small capital, and `DRY_RUN=true` until the preflight is
consistently green.**

### The technical part

The bot uses four separate network transports, and tunnelling only one of them
leaks the rest. A single setting routes all of them:

```env
# .env — per-process proxy (recommended: only the bot is tunnelled)
PROXY_URL=socks5://username:password@proxy-host:1080
REQUIRE_PROXY=true
```

Or leave `PROXY_URL` empty and run a full-tunnel VPN on the machine, with its
kill switch turned on.

### Always check before you trade

```bash
npm run check:vpn
```

This reports where your traffic actually exits, whether that exit is in a
restricted country, whether two independent lookups agree (they disagree when
the tunnel is leaking), and whether Polymarket's endpoints answer. It exits 0
only when it is safe to trade, so you can chain it:

```bash
npm run check:vpn && npx tsx bot-with-dashboard.ts
```

The same check runs automatically at bot startup, and a watchdog re-runs it
every five minutes so a VPN that drops mid-session is reported immediately
rather than showing up as unexplained rejected orders.

---

## 5. Running the Bot

Now the fun part! Let's start the bot with the visual dashboard.

Run this command:

```bash
npx tsx bot-with-dashboard.ts
```

### What happens next?
1. The terminal will show startup logs.
2. It will verify your wallet connection.
3. **The Dashboard will open automatically in your browser** at `http://localhost:3001`.

If it doesn't open, just click that link.

## 7. Risk Management

### 🆕 Multi-Layer Protection System

The bot now has **4 layers of protection** to safeguard your capital:

#### Layer 1: Daily Loss Limit (5%)
- **What it does**: Stops trading if you lose 5% in one day
- **Action**: Pauses for 60 minutes, then resumes
- **Example**: With $250 capital, stops at -$12.50 daily loss

#### Layer 2: Monthly Loss Limit (15%)
- **What it does**: Stops trading if you lose 15% in 30 days
- **Action**: Pauses for 30 days (rest of month)
- **Example**: With $250 capital, stops at -$37.50 monthly loss

#### Layer 3: Drawdown Limit (25%)
- **What it does**: Monitors drop from your peak capital
- **Action**: Pauses for 7 days if exceeded
- **Example**: Peak $300, stops if drops below $225

#### Layer 4: Total Loss Halt (40%)
- **What it does**: **PERMANENT HALT** if total loss reaches 40%
- **Action**: Stops trading entirely, requires manual restart
- **Example**: With $250 capital, halts at -$100 total loss

### 🆕 Smart Position Sizing

The bot now **adapts position sizes** based on performance:

- **Base Size**: 2% of capital (down from 3%)
- **During Losses**: Reduces by 20% per consecutive loss
- **During Wins**: Increases by 10% per consecutive win (capped at 5%)
- **Example**:
  - Normal: $250 × 2% = $5/trade
  - After 3 losses: $5 × 0.8 × 0.8 = $3.20/trade
  - After 5 wins: $5 × 1.4 = $7/trade (capped at $12.50)

## 8. Strategies Explained

The bot comes with 4 powerful strategies. You can toggle them ON/OFF in the dashboard.

### 1. ⚖️ Arbitrage

- **Profit**: Guaranteed math-based profit when the market resolves to $1.00.
- **🆕 v3.1**: Higher profit threshold (1%) to cover gas fees
- **Risk**: Extremely Low.

### 2. 📉 DipArb (Dip Arbitrage)
- **Concept**: Watches for panic selling in 15-minute crypto markets (BTC, ETH).
- **Trigger**: If price crashes >15% in 3 seconds.
- **Action**: Buys the dip (Leg 1) and hedges with the opposite side (Leg 2).
- **🆕 v3.1**: Minimum $1.50 trade value (all positions can be exited)
- **Risk**: Low-Medium (hedged positions).

### 3. 🐋 Smart Money (🆕 Enhanced)

  - ✅ Consistency score 70%+ (recent performance)
  - ✅ No whale trades (max 30% PnL from one trade)
- **Action**: Copies their trades automatically.
- **Risk**: Medium (depends on trader quality).

### 4. ⚡ Direct Trading
- **Concept**: Tools for manual trading with super-powers.
- **Features**:
  - **FOK (Fill or Kill)**: Ensures your whole order fills or cancels.
  - **Sniper**: Quick buy buttons slightly above market price.
- **🆕 v3.1**: Stop-loss (15%), Take-profit (25%), Max hold (7 days)
- **Risk**: Controlled (with new limits).

## 9. Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" error?**
- Make sure you installed Node.js. Restart your computer if you just installed it.

**"Connection Failed"?**
- Check your internet.
- Verify your `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` is correct in `.env`.
- On a VPN or proxy, run `npm run check:vpn` — it names the actual cause instead of a generic failure.

**"Geo preflight failed — refusing to trade"?**
- Your traffic is exiting from a country Polymarket restricts, or the tunnel is down.
- Run `npm run check:vpn` for the detail, then see [`docs/VPN_SETUP.md`](docs/VPN_SETUP.md).

**"Failed to create or derive API key"?**
- Usually a geoblock rather than a wallet problem. Check `npm run check:vpn` first.
- If the exit IP is fine, make sure the wallet has been used on Polymarket at least once.

**Everything worked, then orders started getting rejected?**
- Your VPN most likely dropped mid-session. The geo watchdog logs this every five minutes.
- Turn on your VPN's kill switch, or use `PROXY_URL` + `REQUIRE_PROXY=true` so a dead tunnel errors instead of leaking.

**"Insufficient Funds"?**
- You need both USDC (for trades) and MATIC (for gas) on the **Polygon Network**.

**"Trade value below minimum"?**
- This is the new $1.50 minimum protection. Increase your `CAPITAL_USD` or wait for better prices.

**Bot paused unexpectedly?**
- Check the Risk Status panel - you may have hit a daily/monthly/drawdown limit.
- This is a **safety feature** working as intended.
